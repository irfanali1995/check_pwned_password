# Password Leak Checker

## Overview
This Python script checks the security of user passwords by utilizing the Pwned Password API. It cross-references passwords against a comprehensive database of known breaches and leaks, helping users identify and strengthen potentially compromised passwords.

## Features
- **Efficient Verification:** Utilizes the Pwned Password API to securely and quickly check if a password has been previously compromised.
- **Privacy-Focused:** The script ensures user privacy by not sending the actual password to the API; it only sends a partial hash for matching.
